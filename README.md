# Addressing Catastrophic Interference in Policy Optimization Agents using Continual Deep Reinforcement Learning

This Repo implements the RL agents of [this work](MA-Continual-dRL.pdf).

### Abstract
Catastrophic forgetting in (deep) reinforcement learning is not only an issue for continual learning on different environments, but also inside the same domain. By re-building a model proposed by [A. A. Rusu et al.](https://arxiv:org/abs/1606:04671) and applying it to the intra-environment task setting of [W. Fedus et al.](https://arxiv:org/abs/2002:12499), we present an adapted model and training procedure, the Memento-PNN, that addresses the problem of catastrophic intraenvironment interference.
